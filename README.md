This project delivers a data-driven look at how game context shapes the way pitchers
position themselves when the ball is in play. Using heatmaps generated from anonymized minor
league data, we identified where pitchers most frequently align on base hits into the outfield at
the moment an outfielder releases a throw. Our analysis incorporates key variables — fielder
position, fielder throw strength, exit velocity, and base runners — to quantify and recommend
context-specific pitcher positioning. To support practical application, we developed an
interactive interface that allows users to explore this data based on customizable scenarios.
